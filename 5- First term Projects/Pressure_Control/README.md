# Pressure Controller Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a pressure control system for high-hill climbing cars, ensuring safety by triggering an alarm when the pressure exceeds 20 bars.

## Methodology
We follow the Agile Scrum methodology for software development, allowing us to adapt to evolving customer requirements.

## Requirements
- Specifications:
  - Pressure detection
  - Pressure monitoring
  - Alarm activation
  - Specific duration operation
  - No maintenance for a month
- Assumptions:
  - Sensors and alarm reliability
  - Constant sound level
- Versioning:
  - V1: Initial release
  - V2: Added features (Adaptive alarm, circuit protection)
  - V3: Environmental analysis (temperature, magnetic field, rough waves)

## Space Exploration
Hardware/software partitioning is crucial. Assign tasks to hardware (e.g., pressure sensor, LED) and software (pressure monitoring, main algorithm).
